/**
 * Issues with the Existing Date/Time APIs(Java 7 and Below)
 * Thread Safety – The Date and Calendar classes are not thread safe, leaving developers to deal with the headache of hard to debug concurrency issues 
 * and to write additional code to handle thread safety. On the contrary the new Date and Time APIs introduced in Java 8 are immutable and thread safe, 
 * thus taking that concurrency headache away from developers.
 * 
 * APIs Design and Ease of Understanding – The Date and Calendar APIs are poorly designed with inadequate methods to perform day-to-day operations. 
 * The new Date/Time APIs is ISO centric and follows consistent domain models for date, time, duration and periods. There are a wide variety of utility methods 
 * that support the commonest operations.
 * 
 * ZonedDate and Time – Developers had to write additional logic to handle timezone logic with the old APIs, whereas with the new APIs, handling of timezone can 
 * be done with Local and ZonedDate/Time APIs.
